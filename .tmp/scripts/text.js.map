So every semester we would pick our college courses as a college student would but since we were high school students we were restricted in which courses we could take and did not really have much knowledge of courses that would be useful to our future. \nI was very frustrated with the process of picking courses as it required cross examining multiple documents in order to find the courses that we could take versus what it is that we needed and would be helpful. So I set out to make it easier for the students in my school by compiling everything into a website that would help you pick courses and give current info such as available times for the classes. The website basically gave you everything you needed to pick courses and would even help you pick classes as it had a course picker built in that given your prior classes would suggest classes you should take given what is necessary to graduate with an A.A.\nSo out of my frustration, I made this web app to scrape my college's website in order to get course times and course descriptions and it was a success, students are still using my website to pick classes to this day even after I graduated.`,\n  faIcon: 'graduation-cap'\n}, {\n  link: 'http://onswee.nickthesick.com',\n  html: '<picture> <source srcset=\"http://nickthesick.com/images/onsweeBig.png\" media=\"(min-width: 1000px)\"> <source srcset=\"http://nickthesick.com/images/onsweeMed.png\" media=\"(min-width: 800px)\"> <img srcset=\"http://nickthesick.com/images/onsweeSmall.png\" alt=\"Image of a Tic Tac Toe like game where you are able to move the pieces implemented with AI or multiplayer support.\"> </picture>',\n  projectURL: 'http://github.com/nperez0111/onswee-v2',\n  tags: ['JS', 'Ractive.js', 'Web App', 'AI'],\n  title: 'Onswee V2 ',\n  subtitle: 'A Tic-Tac-Toe like game that requires strategy.',\n  text: 'This is a game I wrote using HTML5, JavaScript and CSS that is similar to Tic Tac Toe but you are able to move your pieces.
